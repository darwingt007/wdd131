            <h1>Health Benefits of Cycling</h1>
        
            <p>Cycling is one of the most effective and accessible forms of exercise for improving overall health.
                It strengthens the cardiovascular system, boosts physical endurance, supports mental well-being,
                and promotes long-term metabolic health.</p>
        
            <h2>Physical Benefits</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Improves cardiovascular efficiency and lung capacity.</li>
                <li>Strengthens major muscle groups such as quadriceps, glutes, hamstrings, and calves.</li>
                <li>Enhances joint mobility with low-impact movement.</li>
                <li>Supports healthy weight management and fat loss.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>Zone 2 Training Benefits (Backed by Dr. Iñigo San-Millán)</h2>
            <p>
                Zone 2 training — typically 60–70% of your maximum heart rate — is considered
                the **metabolic base** of endurance athletes and one of the most powerful tools for
                long-term health. According to Dr. Iñigo San-Millán, the world’s leading metabolic
                researcher and coach of elite athletes like Tadej Pogačar, Zone 2 exercise improves
                health at the **cellular and mitochondrial level**.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Mitochondrial Benefits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Increases mitochondrial number (biogenesis).</li>
                <li>Enhances mitochondrial size and efficiency.</li>
                <li>Improves the body’s ability to use fat as a primary fuel source.</li>
                <li>Reduces lactate accumulation by increasing lactate clearance capacity.</li>
                <li>Strengthens metabolic flexibility — switching between fat and glucose efficiently.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Why Zone 2 Helps People with Diabetes</h3>
            <p>
                Dr. San-Millán’s research demonstrates that Zone 2 cycling is particularly powerful
                for individuals with **Type 2 Diabetes** or metabolic dysfunction. These improvements occur because:
            </p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>It increases insulin sensitivity at the muscular level.</li>
                <li>It reduces chronic inflammation by lowering metabolic stress.</li>
                <li>It enables muscles to use glucose more efficiently without large insulin spikes.</li>
                <li>It restores mitochondrial function, a key dysfunction in diabetes.</li>
                <li>It improves fat oxidation, decreasing the need for excess glucose in the bloodstream.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>
                Because Zone 2 training improves the body’s metabolic engine, Dr. San-Millán
                recommends it as one of the most effective and sustainable forms of exercise
                to **reverse metabolic syndrome** and improve long-term health outcomes.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Mental and Emotional Benefits</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduces stress and cortisol levels.</li>
                <li>Improves cognitive function and memory.</li>
                <li>Boosts mood through endorphins and dopamine release.</li>
                <li>Supports better sleep and emotional balance.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>Cycling provides a powerful blend of physical conditioning, emotional wellness, and metabolic improvement —
                making it an excellent long-term lifestyle habit.</p>

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Start with 2–3 short rides per week (20–40 min)</li>
                <li>Focus on consistency, not speed</li>
                <li>Increase duration gradually</li>
